            <p>
              I love solving problems with computers. I know how to identify, diagnose and fix common hardware and software issues. I can use tools like Device Manager, 
              Task Manager, Event Viewer and System Restore to troubleshoot Windows systems. I can also perform preventive maintenance and security updates to keep the computers running smoothly.

            <h3 id="skill2h3" class="skill2text">Following tech news</h3>
            <p class="skill2text">
              One of my favorite hobbies is keeping up with the latest tech news. I love seeing what new gadgets and innovations are coming out in the market. I find it fascinating and exciting 
              to learn about the features and benefits of these products. Sometimes, when I have some free time or I need a break from work, studying or gaming, I watch videos of new products being launched. 
              I enjoy watching the demos, reviews, and comparisons of these products. I can spend hours just watching these videos and imagining how I would use them in my life.
